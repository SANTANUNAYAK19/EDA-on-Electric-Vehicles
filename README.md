# Electric Vehicles Data Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ”‹
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. It involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizing EV distribution across states, and creating animated plots to track the growth of various EV makes over time. The main goal of the project is to derive insights from the data and present them using compelling visualizations.

# Dataset Summary
The dataset contains information on electric vehicles registered in the U.S., including attributes like:

- VIN (1-10): Partial Vehicle Identification Number.
- Make, Model, Year: Information about the vehicles.
- Electric Vehicle Type: Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
- Electric Range: The maximum range of the EV on a single charge.
- Geographic Information: Location data such as state, city, and postal code.
# Tasks Performed
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Examined the distribution of vehicle makes, model years, electric range, and more.
Bivariate Analysis: Visualized relationships between variables like electric range and base MSRP.
2. Choropleth Map
Created a choropleth map using Plotly Express to display the number of EVs across different U.S. states.
3. Racing Bar Plot
Developed an animated racing bar plot to visualize the change in popularity of various EV makes over the years.
4. LinkedIn Post
Created a professional post to share the project results and experience on LinkedIn.
# Visualizations
  - Choropleth Map: The map shows the distribution of EVs by state. States with higher EV adoption are highlighted with darker colors.
  - Racing Bar Plot: An animated plot displaying how different EV makes have evolved in terms of registration numbers over time.

# Tools and Technologies
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas: To handle and manipulate the dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For static visualizations.
Plotly Express: For interactive and animated visualizations.

# Visual Outputs
 - Choropleth Map: Displays EV distribution across U.S. states.
 - Racing Bar Plot: Animated visualization of EV make evolution over time.

# Conclusion
  This project provided insights into the electric vehicle landscape in the U.S., highlighting key trends and geographic distribution. The combination of EDA and visualization techniques helped make the data more accessible and informative.
